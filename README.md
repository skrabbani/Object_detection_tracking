# Object_detection_tracking

This repository implements YOLOv3 and Deep SORT in order to perfrom real-time object tracking. Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. We can feed these object detections into Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) in order for a real-time object tracker to be created.


## im not uploaded the weights i my repository 
to download the yolov3_weights please refer the link (https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) and yolov3-tiny [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights) then save them to the weights folder.
